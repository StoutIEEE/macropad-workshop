You made the macropad and you're happy with it but maybe you want to learn more and try making a full keyboard.

There's a lot out there to learn. Here are some resources I recommend.

+ [A much better explanation of keyboard matrixes](http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/)
+ [A subreddit about mechanical keyboards, they have a lot of information in their wiki and cool keyboards people have built](https://reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards)
+ [The github page for QMK, the firmware we used in this workshop. They have a lot keyboard building information in their wiki](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
+ [A place to get custom keycaps (and where we got ours for this workshop)](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/)
+ [A place to get keyswitches (and where we got ours for this workshop)](https://www.switchtop.com/)

Good luck out there!
